- remove need for CPU networks by storing evaluations in table during rollout
- use torch.no_grad() appropriately when generating rollouts
- make sure we only collect mean and variance from training period in
EnvNormalized
- fix imports (no more "import *")

- check for rogue tensors (not attached to any particular device)
